### 1. Visit the Parks

Start your adventure at Green Park, which offers a serene escape right in the heart of London. London's parks are not only abundant, but they are also free and quite stunning. As you walk through Green Park, you'll soon find yourself at The Mall. At its end, standing majestically, is the Victoria Monument with the iconic Buckingham Palace as its backdrop. Spend 10-15 minutes here soaking in the grandeur of the palace and the monument, and if you time it right, you might even catch the famed Changing of the Guard ceremony.

Adjacent to Buckingham Palace is St. James's Park, another lush and beautiful place perfect for a leisurely stroll. The park is a sanctuary of tranquility amidst the bustling city, worth every minute spent basking in its beauty.

### 2. Explore Horse Guards Parade

Head over to Horse Guards Parade, where you might catch a ceremonial event or just soak in the historical atmosphere. Just behind the parade grounds, you'll spot the Millennium Wheel and on the right is a charming area perfect for a garden party.

### 3. Downing Street and Iconic Red Telephone Boxes

Just a short walk from Horse Guards Parade is Downing Street, the residence of the UK Prime Minister. Sometimes, you might encounter demonstrations or protests nearby, as I did with the HSBC protest. From there, continue to one of London's most famous red telephone boxes, perfect for iconic photos—just be cautious, as they are not the cleanest.

### 4. Parliament Square and Surroundings

Next on the list is Parliament Square, a must-visit area home to Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, and Westminster Abbey. While the interiors of these landmarks might have entry fees, you can freely admire their exteriors and the surrounding views.

Take a leisurely walk from Westminster down the Victoria Embankment. This riverside walk offers splendid views and is especially lovely on a sunny day.

### 5. Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden

End your tour at Trafalgar Square. With the National Gallery right behind it, you could spend hours admiring magnificent art collections. Unfortunately, the square itself may sometimes be closed for events, but it's a vibrant place worth visiting nonetheless.

Nearby, you'll find Covent Garden, home to the London Transport Museum. While the museum itself may have an entry fee, Covent Garden is brimming with shops, street performances, and captivating architecture. It's an area that beautifully captures the essence of London's energy and culture.

## Starting Our Journey

Our day began at Le Vieux Port, or the Old Port in English, which served as our base for the day. This fantastic little tourist area, surprisingly not too busy, provided the perfect starting point for our adventure. We began by getting our bearings and then took the 55 bus for a 25-minute ride to Notre Dame de la Garde, our first stop.

## Notre Dame de la Garde: The Guardian of Marseille

Notre Dame de la Garde, affectionately known to locals as la Bonne Mère, is probably Marseille's most famous landmark. This impressive basilica, perched on a rocky outcrop, dates back to the mid-19th century. It's fascinating to think that a chapel has stood on this site since the 13th century! While we didn’t film inside to respect those praying, we managed to capture a few photos. Notably, shrapnel scars from World War II still mark the basilica, a poignant reminder of the city’s turbulent history.

We recommend visiting the basilica early in the day before the heat sets in. The hill climb is significant, but the views and the ambiance are more than worth the effort.

## Exploring Le Pannier

Returning to the port, we walked up the other side towards Le Pannier, the oldest quarter of Marseille. Here, by the town hall, we found intriguing statues of a bull and a lion on stilts, unlike anything we've seen elsewhere.

Le Pannier's narrow streets, lined with colourful three to four-story buildings, are home to art shops and soap shops, with beautiful murals adorning the walls. Exploring this area during the day allows the vibrant colors to truly pop. Just a five-minute walk from the port, Le Pannier is a must-visit for anyone in Marseille.

## Museum of Traditional Mediterranean Culture

Heading south, we reached the Museum of Traditional Mediterranean Culture. Even if you're not interested in the exhibits, the free entry allows you to enjoy stunning city views. While filming inside was not permitted, we found the museum ticket amusing; it humorously stated that scooters and skateboards were not allowed, a stark contrast to our small camera.

## The Majestic Palais Longchamp

After admiring more of Marseille’s historic architecture and the thousands of boats moored at the port, we took a 10-minute metro ride to Palais Longchamp. This grand monument, built in the late 1800s, features a lovely park and a couple of museums which we chose to skip. Despite some areas looking run-down due to ongoing renovations for the Paris Olympics, the scale and beauty of this building made it one of our trip's highlights.

## To Palais du Pharo and Beyond

As the heat of the day set in, we took the metro and a 40-minute walk to Palais du Pharo. Built by Napoleon III in the late 1800s, this palace unexpectedly became a cholera and tuberculosis hospital shortly thereafter. Our primary reason for visiting, however, was the views. Overlooking the old port and the museum of Mediterranean culture, the vistas from Palais du Pharo were breathtaking, making the trek worthwhile.

## Concluding at Cathedral de la Major

Our final stop was the majestic Cathedral de la Major. More recent than our earlier basilica visit, this enormous structure near the museum and docks left us in awe. The sheer scale of the cathedral is hard to capture in photos but made for a spectacular end to our 10 and a half hour exploration of Marseille.

## Final Thoughts

And with that, our whirlwind day in Marseille was complete. Reflecting on our experience, I can wholeheartedly say I would visit Marseille again. Contrary to some reviews warning of high crime, we found the city to be welcoming and safe, especially in mid-April. The pleasant weather, friendly locals, and straightforward public transport made our trip enjoyable and hassle-free.

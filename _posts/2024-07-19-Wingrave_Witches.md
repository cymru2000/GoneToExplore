description: What better time to start our October Halloween video series, which will be a trilogy as all good Halloween movies are, than August in the middle of a beautiful field that is pretty much ready to be harvested? I'm here in a small village, or just outside a small village, in Buckinghamshire called Wingrave. My mission? To uncover the story behind a woman accused of witchcraft centuries ago.

### The Journey Begins
As I stood in this charming location, I couldn't help but feel transported back in time. According to local lore, an old lady named Susannah Hannokes was accused of being a witch. Eager to delve deeper into her story, I set off towards Wingrave.

Navigating the footpaths, I spotted a tiny bridge ahead and decided to cross it. Once over, I hoped to find more signs pointing me in the right direction. With my phone guiding me, I continued down the path. I even spotted a deer grazing nearby—an enchanting start to this historical exploration.

### Susannah Hannokes: The Alleged Witch
Born around 300 years ago in the early 1700s, Susannah Hannokes lived a quiet life. Seemingly a widow or spinster, she resided in the village of Wingrave, which was just a little further along my route.

As I walked, hoof prints on the ground suggested I was on a bridle path. It was evident that finding my way back later might be a bit more challenging. Nevertheless, the story of Susannah beckoned.

### An Eccentric Vicar and a Spinning Curse
In 1753, Richard Wooley—though some records suggest his name may have been William—became the vicar of the church in Wingrave. By all accounts, Richard was an eccentric man with strong beliefs, some of which would soon affect Susannah's fate.

A local villager experienced trouble with her spinning wheel, which had gradually stopped functioning. Rather than repair it, she accused Susannah of cursing it. She took her tale to the new vicar, Richard, who fancied himself a witch hunter. Given Susannah's reclusive nature, he believed the villager's story and declared Susannah to be a witch.

### The Witch Trial
Arriving finally in the heart of civilization, I felt much more at ease on paved paths than the rougher trails. Eventually, I reached the church where Susannah had been subjected to one of the oddest witch trials.

Stripped nearly naked down to her shift, Susannah was weighed against a Bible. According to witch hunters, if the Bible weighed more, she would be deemed a witch. Conversely, if Susannah weighed more, she would be considered innocent. Fortunately for her, Susannah weighed more than the Bible and was thereby declared not a witch. Though not without its hardships, her story ended on a relatively positive note.

### Conclusion
As I made my way back down different public footpaths, with more room for my dog and me, I reflected on Susannah's story. Safeguards and sanity may not have always prevailed in history, but Susannah's tale concluded without the horrific fate that befell many accused of witchcraft. Next time, we are heading back to Tring, where the story isn't quite as kind to the alleged witch.
